## Tecnologies and core concepts

### Feature based architecture

The project is divided by features and inside each feature package you'll find a MVVM like architecture. Screens are stateless, the state is managed in `ScreenModel` files. Network requests are made in `Client` files. Request and Response models are in the `shared` module, so consistency between server and client is guaranteed.

### Coroutines & Flow

Both the Ktor backend and the multiplaftorm app are using `Flow` and `suspended` functions all over the place.

### Arrow

The `Either` and `Raise` api are used a lot in the server, so errors are returned as values and not thown as exceptions.

### WebSocket and FirebaseMessaging

The chat feature is achieved using WebSockets, every active room is a socket and sockets are created and deleted based on if there's an user connected. If an user from the room is not connected to the socket when a message is sent(very common scenario) the message is sent through FirebaseMessaging and is received as a push notification in the user's device.
